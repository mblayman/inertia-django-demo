This is my demo app to play around with combining
Django, Vite, and Inertia.js.
There is no goal for this repo aside
from seeing these different project glued together.

One glaring omission from the django-vite docs is
that django-vite *doesn't run Vite for you!*
It expects you to have a Vite project running and is the glue
to bring the Vite app into Django by bridging a Django rendered
template as the Vite entry point.

TODO:

* [ ] Configure Inertia.js and get a couple of pages going.
